# 2 Executive Summary


> **Purpose of this section** – provide senior stakeholders with a concise, non‑technical overview of the quantum‑threat context, the PAREK Framework’s objectives, and the high‑level roadmap that underpins the handbook.  This one‑pager should be intelligible to board members, regulators and project sponsors.


## Executive Summary (draft placeholder – to be expanded in v0.2)
The advent of **cryptographically‑relevant quantum computers (CRQC)** will render today’s RSA and ECC protections ineffective, putting long‑lived confidential data at risk of *harvest‑now‑decrypt‑later* attacks.  To safeguard digital sovereignty and comply with forthcoming EU mandates, organisations must transition to **post‑quantum cryptography (PQC)** well before widely available CRQC capabilities emerge.

The **PAREK Framework** offers a five‑stage lifecycle—**P**ost‑quantum asset & algorithm inventory, **A**ssessment of quantum risk, **R**oad‑mapping & readiness planning, **E**xecution & migration, and **K**ey‑governance & continuous improvement.  It aligns with the EU Coordinated Implementation Roadmap timelines (inventory baseline by 2026, high‑risk cut‑over by 2030, and medium‑risk completion by 2035) and integrates NIST FIPS‑validated algorithms (ML‑KEM, ML‑DSA, SPHINCS+).

Successful adoption hinges on three pillars:
1. **Comprehensive discovery** of cryptographic assets (CBOMs) across the entire estate.
2. **Risk‑based prioritisation** using the Quantum‑Adjusted Risk Score (QARS).
3. **Supplier integration** via contract clauses and machine‑readable attestations.

By following PAREK, the organisation will achieve crypto‑agility, maintain regulatory compliance, and preserve stakeholder trust in the quantum era.
