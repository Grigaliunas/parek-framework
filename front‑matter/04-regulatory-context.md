### Regulatory & Strategic Context***


> **Purpose of this section** – highlight the EU directives, national regulations and international standards that drive the organisation’s post‑quantum transition, and explain how the PAREK Framework aligns with these external obligations.


### 4.1  EU regulatory landscape *(placeholder)*
- **NIS 2 Directive** – security and reporting duties for essential/important entities.  
- **Cyber Resilience Act (CRA)** – forthcoming product‑security requirements incl. cryptographic transparency.  
- **EU Coordinated Implementation Roadmap for PQC (2025)** – joint milestones: inventory 2026, high‑risk cut‑over 2030, medium‑risk 2035.  

*(Detailed mapping to be added when national transposition timelines are confirmed.)*

### 4.2  Strategic alignment *(placeholder)*
Describe how the organisation’s cyber‑security strategy, data‑classification policy and digital‑sovereignty goals intersect with PQC adoption.

### 4.3  External standards map *(placeholder)*
| Standard            | Status  | Relevance to PAREK |
| ------------------- | ------- | ------------------ |
| **NIST FIPS 203‑205** | Final   | Baseline algorithms (ML‑KEM, ML‑DSA, SPHINCS+) |
| ISO/IEC DIS 14888‑4 | Draft   | PQ signatures      |
| ETSI TS 103 829     | Stable  | Hybrid key exchange |

*(Will expand once draft texts are ratified.)*


> Subsequent revisions will add jurisdiction‑specific compliance deadlines, cross‑reference to §15 KPIs, and commentary on industry guidance (e.g., ENISA reports).
